## About me.

My name is **Andrey**, I'm from Minsk, Belarus. I have degree in Engineering in Prevention and elimination of emergencies , and I was working as a firefighter for about 10years. This year I was lucky to start studying JS in **PandaDoc**. I always wanted to start learning programming and I'm really glad I've got this oportunity this year at PandaDoc!
I'm keen on modern tehnologies, crossfit, rollerblading, cool movie and music.
